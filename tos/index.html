                1.2 Except for your pre-existing rights and the limited license granted herein,
                Delphos retains ownership of all text, images, videos, interfaces, graphics, software, code, and other content within the Site and Services

                or create derivative works based on the Site, Services, or Delphos-generated Content,
                in whole or in part, unless expressly authorized in writing by Delphos.
                No express or implied rights are granted to you beyond what is stated in these Terms.

                If payments are not made on time, Delphos may restrict access to your account.  <br><br>

                2.2 Any information you provide to Delphos in relation to a purchase, transaction, or other financial activity must be accurate, complete, and up to date.
                You are responsible for all charges made using your credit card, debit card, or other payment method at the applicable rates at the time of the transaction.

                <strong>4. Restrictions</strong>  <br><br>

                4.1 You are required to comply with all applicable laws when accessing or using our Site or Services.
                Unless expressly permitted by applicable law or explicitly authorized in writing by Delphos, you agree that you will not,
                and you will not permit anyone else to: <br><br>

                (i) Store, copy, modify, distribute, or resell any information, audio, visual, audiovisual works,
                or any other content made available through our Services (collectively referred to as "Delphos Content"),
                nor compile or aggregate any Delphos Content into a database or other collection; <br><br>

                (ii) Utilize any automated tool, including but not limited to bots, spiders, or scrapers, to access our Services
                or to store, copy, modify, distribute, or resell any Delphos Content; <br><br>

                (iii) Rent, lease, sublicense, or otherwise transfer your access to the Services to another person or entity; <br><br>

                (iv) Circumvent, disable, or interfere with any digital rights management tools, security mechanisms, or
                usage restrictions implemented within our Services; <br><br>

                (v) Engage in any activity that places excessive demand on our Services, interferes with their operation,
                or compromises their security, performance, or availability; <br><br>

                (vi) Remove, alter, obscure, or tamper with any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary notices
                present on any portion of our Services or any Delphos Content; <br><br>

                (vii) Reproduce, modify, translate, adapt, enhance, decompile, disassemble, reverse engineer, or
                create derivative works from any aspect of our Services. <br><br>

                <strong>5. Intellectual Property</strong>  <br><br>

                5.1 Delphos provides access to its proprietary soundworld technology through its Services.
                Some of these soundworlds are owned, developed, and trained by Delphos, while others are created and maintained by third parties,
                and in some cases, you may have the ability to train your own soundworlds (the "Soundworld Owner").
                Each soundworld operates under its own specific license, which dictates the terms of use,
                including but not limited to intellectual property rights such as copyright, composition rights, master recording rights,
                and any other derivative music rights. These rights are defined by the license governing each individual soundworld
                and may be modified at any time at the sole discretion of the Soundworld Owner.
                It is your responsibility to stay informed of any changes and to ensure ongoing compliance with the applicable licensing terms. <br><br>

                5.2 If you choose to input music into the Services, you expressly represent, warrant, and affirm that you are the rightful owner
                of all necessary rights to such music or that you have obtained explicit, written permission from the rights holder to use the music
                in connection with the Services. This includes, but is not limited to, rights related to composition, master recordings, performance,
                and any derivative works. You further agree that you will not submit, upload, or otherwise introduce into the Services any music, audio,
                or sound recordings for which you lack proper authorization, and you acknowledge that any unauthorized use may constitute a violation of
                intellectual property laws, potentially resulting in legal consequences. Delphos reserves the right, at its sole discretion, to remove,
                restrict, or suspend access to any content that it believes, in good faith, may infringe upon the rights of others or violate the terms of use. <br><br>

                5.3 If you develop and train your own soundworld using the Services, you retain full and exclusive ownership of all copyright, intellectual property rights,
                and any associated derivative works produced by that soundworld. This means that any compositions, recordings, or other outputs generated by
                your trained soundworld are solely your property, granting you the unrestricted ability to use, license, distribute, monetize, or otherwise
                exploit them as you see fit. Delphos makes no claim to ownership or control over the rights to any soundworlds you independently train and
                develop through the platform. However, by utilizing the Services, you acknowledge that you remain fully responsible for ensuring that your
                trained soundworld does not infringe upon the rights of third parties, including copyrights, trademarks, and other intellectual property protections. <br><br>

                <strong>6. Privacy Policy</strong>  <br><br>

                6.1 Through your use of our Services, we may gather various types of information, including but not limited to registration details,

                and utilize this information is subject to the terms outlined in our Privacy Policy, which can be accessed at delphos.ai/privacy.

                7.1 Certain areas of our Services, including but not limited to account management functions, may be restricted to registered users or
                other authorized individuals and require a password for access. You acknowledge and agree that you bear sole responsibility for maintaining
                the confidentiality and security of your password. In the event that your password is lost, stolen, disclosed to an unauthorized party, or
                otherwise compromised, you must notify us without delay. Furthermore, you accept full responsibility for all actions and transactions conducted
                under your account, regardless of whether you personally authorized them. You further agree to promptly inform us of any unauthorized access to
                your account, any suspected security breaches, or any other compromise related to your password, our Site, or our Services that comes to your attention. <br><br>

                8.2 We do not oversee, verify, or assume responsibility for the accuracy, reliability, or quality of any Third-Party Content.
                We make no guarantees regarding the performance, legitimacy, or appropriateness of such content and expressly disclaim any responsibility

                or information accessed through our platform. It is solely your responsibility to assess and determine the validity, accuracy, and suitability
                of any information, opinions, advice, or other content available on or linked through our Site. <br><br>
